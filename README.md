# AWS DevOps Demo

This is a small demo project to showcase an end-to-end DevOps workflow on AWS using:
- A minimal Flask (or Node.js) application
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Planned Features
- Deploy a single container to AWS ECS (Fargate)
- Integrate with DynamoDB (optional) for simple data storage
- Automated builds and deployments on push/merge to `main`
